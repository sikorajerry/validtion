027=Another component appears as a dataset attribute in data file 
028=The dataset has an attribute with different attachment level 
029=An attribute at dataset, series or observation level has a value which is not valid in the referenced codelist 
030=Appears when reported value of a concept is unexpected 
031=The dataset contains groups which contains components that are not defined as group componenets in the DSD 
032=Observation missing time dimension for time series data 
033=Appears if there is a constraint on the dataset which does not allow observations
034=Appears if there is a constraint which specify report start date and the observation time is before this date
035=Appears if there is a constraint which specify report end date and the observation time is after this date
036=Appears if there is a constraint on the dataset which does not allow series
037=Appears if the dimension is not allowed in the key due to an existing constraint
038=Appears when the series key contains some value which is disallowed by included constraints
039=Appears when more than one observation are found in one series 
040=It appears when a custom validation rule does not pass. Data validation failed : Failure("checkDataSetAttributeValue")
041=The cross-sectional component is attached to a wrong level 
042=Appears if the TIME_PERIOD attribute does not match the TIME_FORMAT 
043=If the dataset header contains a URN reference to other artefact then expected 
044=The structure file supplied to the STRUVAL service call does not contain a dataflow (identified by agency, name, and version) that is referenced from the dataset
045=The structure file supplied to the STRUVAL service call does not contain a DSD (identified by agency, name, and version) that is referenced from the dataset
046=When an  XML attribute is in the wrong element
047=If the dataset has a structure reference which is neither DSD or Dataflow
048=DSDs that STRUVAL can process must contain a time dimension
049=Appears when the struval tries to validate a header but the given dataset file is not detected as been one of the following formats: COMPACT_2_0,GENERIC_2_0,CROSS_SECTIONAL_2_0, UTILITY_2_0, GENERIC_2_1,GENERIC_2_1_XS,COMPACT_2_1 or COMPACT_2_1_XS
